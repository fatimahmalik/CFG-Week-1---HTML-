  <p>Hi everyone I'm Fatimah and I'm 18 years old. I'm from London, and I hope to study English Literature at university. This is my first time participating in a coding course and I'm finding it really interesting!</p>
   <ul><h3>My Favourite Things To Do</h3>
    <li>Travelling - one of my favourite countries that I've been lucky to visit is Switzerland</li>
    <li>Watching movies/shows on Netflix - I'm currently watching 'The Vampire Diaries' and I love it!</li>
    <li>Going out with my friends</li>

   <h4> My Book Recommendations </h4>
   <p>As I want to pursue English Literature, I've pushed myself to read lots of brilliant books in preparation. I'm currently reading 'The Hobbit' by J.R.R Tolkein, but I thought I would share my top 3 favourite books I've read so far.</p>
   <ol>
   <li> 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' by Khalid Hosseini </li>
   <li> 'Jane Eyre' by Charlotte Bronte </li>

  <p>Hi everyone I'm Fatimah and I'm 18 years old. I'm from London, and I hope to study English Literature at university. This is my first time participating in a coding course and I'm finding it really interesting!</p>
   <ul><h3>My Favourite Things</h3>
    <li>Travelling - one of my favourite countries that I've been lucky to visit is Switzerland</li>
    <li>Watching movies/shows on Netflix - I'm currently watching 'The Vampire Diaries' and I love it!</li>
